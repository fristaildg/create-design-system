This will start ladle in http:localhost:61000

## Bundle your library for publishing

```bash
npm run build
```

## Test you bundle locally before publishing

```bash
npm pack
```

This will create a .tar file (with the exact same content that would be published to npm) which you can `npm install` in any react / next / remix application of yours.
You will be able to consume the library from that application as if it was coming from a published package.

## Publish your library to npm

```bash
npm publish
```

Just make sure the name of your library is available in npm

## Update your published library

```bash
npm version major / minor / patch
npm publish
```

This will bump your library's version according to the semver standards
